# azure-data-engineer---multi-source
##📌 Project Overview
![project Pipeline](https://github.com/emmanuel-cheruiyot737/azure-data-engineer---multi-source/blob/main/cherry.png)

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline on Microsoft Azure to analyze Olympic Games data. It covers the entire data lifecycle — ingestion → storage → transformation → analytics → visualization — enabling insights into medal tallies, athlete performance, gender participation, and sports evolution over time
Architecture

The solution follows a modern data engineering architecture on Azure:

Data Source – Olympic datasets (CSV, JSON, APIs, historical repositories).

Ingestion (Azure Data Factory) – Automated pipelines for data ingestion, scheduling, and monitoring.

Raw Storage (Azure Data Lake Gen2 - Raw Zone) – Stores unprocessed data for traceability.

Transformation (Azure Databricks) – PySpark notebooks for cleaning, joining, and applying business rules (e.g., medal aggregation, athlete demographics).

Curated Storage (Azure Data Lake Gen2 - Curated Zone) – Stores structured and analytics-ready datasets.

Analytics & Querying (Azure Synapse Analytics) – Star schema modeling, SQL queries for medal tallies, athlete performance, and country comparisons.

Visualization (Power BI / Looker Studio / Tableau) – Interactive dashboards showing:

🥇 Country medal leaderboards

👩‍🦱 Athlete demographics (age, gender, sport)

📈 Sports growth & popularity trends

🕒 Olympic history & participation
